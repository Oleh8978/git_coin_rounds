Installation and Execution GuideThis guide outlines the steps to install the necessary dependencies and run the provided Python script.PrerequisitesPython 3.10: Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.pip: Python's package installer, pip, should come with your Python installation. You can check if it's installed by running pip --version in your terminal.1. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)It's generally recommended to create a virtual environment for each Python project. This isolates the project's dependencies and avoids conflicts with other projects.Create a virtual environment:Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.Run the following command:python -m venv .venv  # Or: python3 -m venv .venv
This will create a virtual environment in a directory named .venv.Activate the virtual environment:On macOS and Linux:source .venv/bin/activate
On Windows:.venv\Scripts\activate
Once the virtual environment is activated, your terminal prompt will change to show the environment name (e.g., (.venv) $).2. Install DependenciesNavigate to the directory containing the Python script.Install the required packages using pip:pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost joblib
This command will install the following packages:pandas: For data manipulation.scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.xgboost: For the XGBoost Regressor model.joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.3. Prepare the DataEnsure that the data files (dataset_new.csv and projects_Apr_1.csv) are located in the datasets directory, as specified in the script.  If the data is in a different location, you'll need to modify the dataset_path and projects_path variables in the Python script to point to the correct file paths.4. Run the ScriptOpen your terminal, make sure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one), and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.Run the script using the following command:python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.5. Check the OutputThe script will print the 5-fold cross-validation RMSE and the validation RMSE and RÂ² to the console.It will also save the predictions to a CSV file named submission.csv in the same directory.The trained model will be saved as model.pkl.
